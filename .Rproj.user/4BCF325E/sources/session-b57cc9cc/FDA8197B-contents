# STAT 545 Assignment B1 - Hannah Hauch 
This repository contains **Assignment B1** by *Hannah Hauch*. In this assignment I practiced making, documenting, and testing a function. 

The work for this assignment in in the assignment B1 files. In this repository there is both the rmd and md files. In these files you will see that I created a function (named summary_table), gave examples, and tested it. The Assignment B1.md file is the knitted output of the markdown file of Assignment B1.rmd. 

Within this repository there are two other folders which hold the .gitignore, .RData, .Rhistory, and .Rproj. 

The code in this repository is written in R and can be run in Rstudio. The files in this repository are RMarkdown files and must be require Rstudio and R. To execute the files, the repository can be locally cloned or downloaded and the files can be opened in RStudio. The files use multiple packages (tidyverse, roxygen2, datateacher, dplyr, etc.). If needed install packages using: install.packages("*package name*"). To knit the files click knit in Rstudio and the files will be converted to markdown files.
